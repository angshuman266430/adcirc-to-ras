# ADCIRC netCDF to RAS Compliant data
A set of scripts using command-line interface arguments to convert ADCIRC netCDF data to RAS compliant data. This includes 2D wind and 1D downstream boundary surge timeseries data.

Often this data processing is project specific so check the branches for specific projects. For example: [LWI calibration/validation](https://github.com/mylesmc123/adcirc-to-ras/tree/lwi-coastwide-cal)

the specific model brnaches will have more in-depth readme information and project-specific scripting.
